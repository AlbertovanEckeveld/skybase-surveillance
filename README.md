# 🌌 Skybase Surveillance

**Skybase Surveillance** is a high-performance, Rust-based application for **automated RTSP camera health checking** and **minute-based video recording**. It stores recordings in a structured directory format and uses **PostgreSQL** for camera stream management.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Loads configuration from `config.toml`
- 📡 Connects to a PostgreSQL database to fetch camera streams
- 🛡️ Performs RTSP health checks using FFmpeg
- 🎥 Records 1-minute video segments for healthy cameras
- 🗂️ Saves recordings in a clean, configurable folder structure
- 💻 Works on both **Windows** and **Linux**

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [Rust (stable)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Cargo (included with Rust)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (must be installed and in your `PATH`)
- Docker (optional, for cross-compilation or containerization)

host = "localhost"
port = 5432

[app]
records_path = "./records"
```
